Our web application detects the μg/m3 of following gases in the surrounding:

```
NO(Nitric Oxide)
NO2(Nitrogen Dioxide)
NH3(Ammonia)
O3(Ozone)
SO2(Sulfer Dioxide)
CO(Carbon Monoxide)

```
Air quality detection and prediction web application `detects maximum pollutants` in the air and shows the quality of 

surrounding air as `levels 1 to 5` where 1 being the best quality of air. It `detects different gases` in the air and shows it's

μg/m3. By the 24 hours of data it `predicts the air quality for next day as well.`
